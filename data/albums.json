      "description": "We were on the road in 2023, cross country, from Minneapolis back to San Francisco. It’s been an incredible trip with me and my little brother Pierre Henri. We’ve been driving for 5 days, having the most incredible time. But ever since leaving the hotel in Yellowstone, there is a tenseness on the edge of my nerves. We should keep moving. It is my first time on this trip intersecting with a previous journey - 12 years earlier I rode this very road on my first motorcycle, I was only 25. Hmmm, something does not feel right. We get into Jackson Hole. The amazing bar where I picked up the girls and we all rode our bikes to their ski bum house, her on the back of my bike, that bar is now a remodeled luxury soulless place. They murdered it and propped up the skeleton with a rigor mortis smile, and want us to believe that, no no, look how happy he is! Look at that fat smile! There’s blonde girls in yoga pants with toned butts bouncing on electric bikes. They look delicious in the way fast food looks delicious in the ads. With that mindset I get back in the car with Pierre Henri. After I’ve taken a few creeper photos of said blonde butts. The sense of a moment in time that’s lost mixes with the crackling pressure. Cmon let’s move. It’s a beautiful sunset over the lakes but the colors are off. Desaturated. Is there dust covering everything? I faintly remember being on the old KZ650 on the same road, Eric lagging in the distance behind, me staying close to Pags on his 750. But mostly I don’t remember. Slowly industry appears. Tin warehouses. Railroad ties. And then Salt Late City. We are going to go find a hotel. I also want to go see where I visited to potentially by a PhD student. Absolutely no memory of any of the buildings. Was I here? It’s manicured and clean. Like an embalmed corpse. Death? The Mormon church on the corner is not on the corner, it is the corner, it is the goddamn city block. McDonalds. A black couple fighting in the parking lot loudly. PH and I laugh, crack jokes, very sardonically so. We drive around. “Dude do you have another few hours in you?” “Fuck yea I don’t want to stay here either” “Let’s run for the border” “LET’S”. Nothing about that town makes me want to be there. \n\nNow, years later, I’m in first class, flying over. 2:12am on the red eye. The pallid gash of orange sulphur lights from SLC glaring up at me. Mount Doom.  Don’t ask me to explain it, just see for yourself.",
