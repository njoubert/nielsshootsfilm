## Impact by Category

### Complexity Reduction

| Category | Before | After | Change |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Tool configs | 850 lines | 50 lines | -94% |
| Testing strategy | 600 lines | 80 lines | -87% |
| Analytics | 260 lines | 10 lines | -96% |
| Blog features | 25 lines | 8 lines | -68% |
| Downloads | 55 lines | 10 lines | -82% |

### Focus Improvement

**Before**: 
- All features presented with equal weight
- No clear MVP path
- Overwhelming amount of detail upfront

**After**:
- Clear MVP vs Phase 8 distinction
- Quick Start shows critical path
- "What to Skip Initially" section
- Detailed configs in appendix for reference

### Readability

**Before**: 5,862 lines - difficult to grasp scope  
**After**: 3,917 lines - manageable, focused on MVP

## Key Principles Applied

1. **MVP-First**: Core functionality (albums + admin) is clear priority
2. **Defer Advanced Features**: Blog, analytics, downloads → Phase 8
3. **Simplify Testing**: Pre-commit + manual E2E for MVP
4. **Reference, Don't Embed**: Tool configs in separate doc
5. **Show the Path**: Quick Start at top makes priorities obvious

---

## What's in Phase 8 Now

All advanced features clearly marked for later:

- Blog functionality
- Photo/album downloads with quality selector
- Analytics tracking and dashboard
- Automated test suite (Playwright E2E, component tests)
- Client-side bcrypt password verification
- ZIP generation for album downloads
- Code coverage requirements
- Multiple admin users
