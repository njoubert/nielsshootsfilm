---

## Issues Found

**None** - All functionality working as expected

---

## Performance Notes

- Average API response time: < 100ms
- Session cookie lifetime: 24 hours
- Album CRUD operations: Instant (JSON file-based storage)
- No memory leaks observed during testing

---

## Security Observations

✅ **Passed Security Checks**:

- Authentication required for admin endpoints
- Session cookies use HttpOnly flag (prevents XSS)
- SameSite=Strict prevents CSRF
- Sessions properly invalidated on logout
- 401 responses for unauthorized access
- Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes
- Admin credentials loaded from external config file

---

## Recommendations

1. ✅ Authentication system working correctly
2. ✅ CRUD operations fully functional
3. ✅ Session management properly implemented
4. ✅ Data persistence working as expected
5. ✅ Frontend routing configured

**No critical issues found - system ready for manual UI testing**

---

## Next Steps

1. Manual browser testing of admin UI pages
2. Test photo upload functionality (when implemented)
3. Test password-protected album access flow
4. Performance testing with larger datasets
5. Cross-browser compatibility testing

---

## Test Artifacts

- Cookie file: `/tmp/e2e_test_cookies.txt`
- Test album ID: `10aeaff5-aba1-4f7a-bb11-175d6610e9bd` (deleted)
- Data file: `data/albums.json` (verified intact)

---

## Conclusion

All E2E API tests passed successfully. The admin authentication system, album CRUD operations, and session management are working correctly. The system properly persists data and handles security concerns appropriately. Ready for next phase of testing.
