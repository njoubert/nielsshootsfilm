## Navigation Flow

### Complete Admin Navigation Map

```text
Public Site (/) ←─────┐
                      │
                      │ (click site title)
                      │
Login (/admin/login) ──→ Dashboard (/admin)
                              │
                              ├──→ Albums (/admin/albums)
                              │      │
                              │      ├──→ New Album (/admin/albums/new)
                              │      └──→ Edit Album (/admin/albums/:id/edit)
                              │
                              ├──→ Settings (/admin/settings)

                              └──→ Logout → Login
```

### Key Navigation Features

1. **Site Title Always Visible**: Every admin page shows the site title in the header, which links back to the public homepage
2. **Tab Navigation**: Dashboard, Albums, and Settings are accessible from any admin page
3. **Active Page Indicator**: Current page is highlighted in the tab navigation
4. **Consistent Logout**: Logout button available on all admin pages

## Technical Details

### State Management

All admin pages now load and display:

- Site configuration (for site title in header)
- Page-specific data (albums, settings, etc.)
- Loading and error states

### Form Handling

Settings page implements:

- Multiple form sections with independent save actions
- Client-side validation before submission
- Backend integration via admin API utilities
- Optimistic UI updates with error rollback

### Backend Integration

No backend changes required - all endpoints were already implemented:

- ✅ `GET /api/config` - Fetch site config
- ✅ `PUT /api/admin/config` - Update site config
- ✅ `PUT /api/admin/config/main-portfolio-album` - Set portfolio album
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/change-password` - Change password
- ✅ `GET /api/albums` - Fetch all albums

### Code Quality

- ✅ **TypeScript**: All new code is fully typed
- ✅ **Type Checking**: Passes `npm run typecheck` with no errors
- ✅ **Linting**: Passes `npm run lint` with no errors
- ✅ **Consistent Styling**: Follows existing CSS variable patterns
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts

- ✅ ESLint: **PASS**
- ⏳ Unit tests: **To be added** (out of scope for this implementation)

### Manual Testing Required

As per MVP plan, manual E2E testing is recommended before deployment:

**Admin Navigation Flow**:

1. [ ] Visit `/admin` → Redirects to `/admin/login`
2. [ ] Login with credentials → Redirects to `/admin` (dashboard)
3. [ ] Dashboard displays correct stats
4. [ ] Click "Albums" tab → Navigate to `/admin/albums`
5. [ ] Click "Settings" tab → Navigate to `/admin/settings`
6. [ ] Click "Dashboard" tab → Navigate back to `/admin`
7. [ ] Click site title → Navigate to `/` (public site)

**Settings Page**:

1. [ ] Load `/admin/settings` → All fields populated
2. [ ] Update site title → Save → Verify change reflected in header
3. [ ] Update owner info → Save → Verify success message
4. [ ] Select portfolio album → Save → Verify success
5. [ ] Change password → Save → Verify can login with new password

**Header Consistency**:

1. [ ] Verify admin-header appears on all admin pages
2. [ ] Verify site title is clickable and links to `/`
3. [ ] Verify logout button works from any page
4. [ ] Verify active tab highlights correctly
